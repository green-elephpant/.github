## Green ElePHPant

Made for the üåé by Carsten Windler

### üêò What's it about?

To combat the Climate Crisis, everyone needs to do their share - also we Software Developers. The idea of Green Software Engineering is still not very popular, but recently it has gained a lot of traction.

The Green ElePHPant wants to become a set of tools, ideas and best practices to enable every PHP developer to participate. 

### ü•∑ How to fight Climate Change as a Developer

Green Software Engineering is a highly fascinating field. It goes way beyond the "normal" software engineering and includes knowledge about science, green technologies, energy markets, hardware, and much more.

### üëã Who is involved?

So far, the Green ElePHPant is a one-man show. Hopefully, this will change soon! _CONTRIBUTORS WELCOME!_

## Projects

### CarbonAware

https://github.com/green-elephpant/carbon-aware

The first and probably most important piece of _Green ElePHPant_ is the _CarbonAware_ toolkit. Its aim is to provide an easy way for all PHP developers to reduce carbon emissions of their code.

How does it work? Well, we are right in a transition period, from fossile to renewable energy.

Renewable energies unfortunately not very reliable. The better the conditions, means more wind and sunshine, the greener the electricity becomes. 

A fundamental concept of Green Software Engineering is Time Shifting: let's move the workload of our systems to times when the electricity that out servers consume is causing less carbon emissions, if possible.

### CodeBench

You want to optimize your code to save emissions, but don't know where to start? _CodeBench_ can help you identify slow functions and other bottlenecks.
